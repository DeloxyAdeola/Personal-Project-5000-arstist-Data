The 5000 artist song project  is an independent project done by me. I studied this data closely on this project to acheive a clear visualozation using Power BI.
This Data is a CSV file that  was downloaded from Kaggle it's called top 5000 songs. After studying this data, i can firmly say that the file has 9 columns (fields ) and 5000 rows (features)
I tranformed the data by checking for duplicates, droping null values, deleted unwanted rows and columns and ensure the data is ready for accurate visualization . 
Findings
